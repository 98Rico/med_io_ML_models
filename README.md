# MedIo Machine Learning Models

The following repository contains three folder:

-2D_CNN_RGB <br /> 
-3D_CNN <br /> 
-dual_channel <br /> 

Each folder correpond to a different method we experimented during our project. In each folder there is one main notebook and a second one which corresponds to data pre-processing. In addition, there is a notice to expalin how to set-up properly before running these algorithms.
